# Exploratory Data Analysis Project 2
## Overview
### This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focusing on analyzing and visualizing a dataset. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and explores various aspects of the data to derive meaningful insights.

## Project Notebook
### * The main project notebook can be found here: project2.ipynb.

## Project Objectives
### The primary objectives of this EDA project are:

>* Dataset Exploration: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
>* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, or any necessary preprocessing steps.
>* Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to derive key metrics and characteristics of the data.
>* Data Visualization: Utilize visualizations to represent trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
>* Insights and Conclusions: Draw meaningful insights from the analysis and present conclusions.
>* Technologies Used
>* The project is implemented using the following technologies and libraries:

## Jupyter Notebook
>* Python
>* Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
>* Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
>* How to View the Project
>* To view and interact with the project notebook:

## Access the project2.ipynb file in the repository.
## GitHub renders Jupyter Notebooks, allowing you to view the content directly on the GitHub page.
### Project Structure
#### The notebook is structured into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis. Sections may include data loading, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation.
